#### Cass80

Cass80 is a tool to load, analyze, disassemble or list, modify,
and save EACA Colour-Genie 2000 and Video-Genie 3003 (which was
a TRS-80 clone) cassette images.

This is a Work-In-Progress and I use it to analyze and clean up
old "*.cas" images I had lying around in my archives for many
yers. The results will be added to [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/)
hash list (softlist) for the Colour Genie cassettes.
